On this project we learned more about system administrate, security and GNU Linux on a VM. Everything was configured without a graphic interface (which was pretty interesting to me, who wasn't used to using the terminal, etc).


It was a matter of configuring, not exactly coding, so there's nothing like that to share, but a script I wrote in order to periodically show some specific system informations using `cron`.
